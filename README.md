We have spent the last three months working hard to become software developers, and all your hard work has paid off! 

Now it's time for the _really fun part!_ Using your new skills as a developer, you will continue to grow and let your interests and passions guide your studies and career path as you embark on your post cohort journey.

# 💫 Success Strategies

> _Success is when preparation meets opportunity_

Treat your studies and employment search like a 9 - 5 job: _punch in at 9 am and work until 5 pm_
- Divide your time between job searching, networking, white boarding, learning, and developing projects for your portfolio.

Maintain a community going post cohort: _Stay connected with your peers to support each other and thrive together._
- Create and maintain a community space for your cohort (Slack, Facebook groups, Discord!)
- Organize regular meetups and study halls
- Collaborate on projects
- Do whiteboard and coding challenge practice in groups

**Code. Every. Day**
- The idea here is **consistency**. If you can commit to coding for at least one hour every day, you will be an expert in your craft within five years. Not just good, an expert. You've heard us say it before, it's about the reps. The more time you spend coding, the faster you will gain that deeper understanding.
- Stay active on your GitHub and **Code Every Day**! Not only will you be keeping your skills sharp, but you'll also be filling your GitHub heat map with wonderful green squares! 
- [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) is a challenge for developers to commit to coding for at least one hour for the next hundred days.

[_Eat the Frog_](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eat-the-frog): _A productivity technique for combatting procrastination_
- If there's a task you don't want to do but have to do every day: _do it first_. **Everyday.** **_Eat the Frog first thing._** 🐸

# 📖 Solidifying Foundations 

It is _highly_ recommended that you take some time to review the material from the cohort to solidify and deepen your understanding of the concepts we learned in class.
